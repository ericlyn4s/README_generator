# README Generater

## Description

I created this project for two reasons. First, I wanted to make a tool that would save me time on future projects - creating README files. This process usually requires several steps of tracking down a template, filling out relevant sections while deleting others, and tracking down my license on GitHub and pasting it below. By creating this tool, these steps are done for me and output into a professional-looking file. Secondly, I wanted to practice my understanding of Node.js and template literals. This is my first foray into node and it's been exciting seeing the simplicity and ease that this framework can provide. I never imagined creating a README file from my command line, but after seeing how relatively easy this process is, I'm considering more advanced possibilties offered by node.
I also appreciated learning more about template literals, as I've seen these in other code and understand them to be quite common. I now feel comfortable in utilizing these in future projects.

## Installation

This project can be forked from my GitHub repository here:

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
